# Help

Show the user what's available.

## Instructions

### 1. Read Preferences (Optional)

If `.assistant/preferences.md` exists, read it to check adhd_mode.

### 2. Present Commands

```
Here's what I can do:

DAILY WORKFLOW
  /gm          Good morning — start your day
  /checkin     Check in on progress
  /stuck       Help when overwhelmed

SECOND BRAIN (just say it naturally)
  "capture this"         Quick capture to inbox
  "plan my day"          Daily planning with priorities
  "process my inbox"     GTD inbox processing
  "daily closeout"       End of day review
  "create a diagram"     Excalidraw diagrams

COMMUNICATION
  /draft       Draft an email or message
  /polish      Improve existing text

WEEKLY
  /pw          Plan the week ahead
  /week        Review the past week

SYSTEM
  /help        Show this list
  /setup       Re-run setup wizard
  /skills      Find and install new skills
  /profile     View or change settings
  /status      System health check
  /update      Check for skill updates
  /heal        Fix broken skills

Or just talk to me naturally — I understand plain language.
```

## Notes

- Keep it clean and scannable
- Don't explain what each command does in detail — the one-liner is enough
- If ADHD mode, consider showing fewer commands grouped by "most used"
